# Part I: Getting up and Running
In this part we will spend our time getting our R and Rstudio environments up and running.
## Installation
1. Go [here to download R and RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) - **NB** They are separate downloads and installs
2. Alternatively [make an account on RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)
## Orientation
1. Pete will lead a guided tour of RStudio - (core takeaway: type code into console and see what happens)
2. Everyone else will interrupt Pete with questions
## Environment Test
1. write our first program - 'hello world'
2. working directories and paths and files ..... oh my.
