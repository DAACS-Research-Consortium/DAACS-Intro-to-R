# Part III: Variables and Data Structures
In this part we are going to dig into some code and investigate what is going on. Along the way we will learn about variables and data structures.

## Exercise 1
1. Run the first 30 lines of code. (pete will demonstrate, everyone can follow along, questions encouraged)
    * [link to code](https://github.com/alonzi/DAACS-Intro-to-R/blob/main/RWorkshop1_SCV.R) (n.b. still the same code as previous exercises)
    * load libraries
    * call a function `read.csv`

### Let's talk about `<-`
1. Take a look at line 19 in the code
2. What do you not understand?

**Takeaway:** The `<-` operator 'catches' the output of functions and stores them in variables.

## Exercise 2
1. Take a look at the Environment panel
2. Investigate `StewartCastleVillage` with the GUI
3. Investigate `StewartCastleVillage` with code
   * use typeof(...)
   * use length(...)

4. If we haven't seen an error message yet we will talk about error messages

### Takeaway
Variables are labels that we create to make handling objects easier. We have many tricks to help us remember what a variable represents.
