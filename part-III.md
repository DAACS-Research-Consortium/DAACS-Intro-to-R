# Part III: Investigating Code
In this part we are going to dig into some code and investigate what is going on. Our main goal will be to understand what is going on in R for the first 30 lines of our sample code. In this will will also dig into the concept of variables and types and the more complicated structures we can build from them.

## Variables and Data Structures
### Exercise 1
1. Run the first 30 lines of code. (pete will demonstrate, everyone can follow along, questions encouraged)
    * [link to code](https://github.com/TJF-Monticello/Chronology/blob/master/MCD-CA%20Code/CA_MCD_URCode.R) (n.b. still the same code as previous exercises)
    * load libraries
    * call a function `read.csv`

### Exercise 2
1. Take a look at the Environment panel
2. Investigate MCDTypeTable with the GUI
3. Investigate MCDTypeTable with code
   * use typeof(...)
   * use length(...)

4. If we haven't seen an error message yet we will talk about error messages

### Takeaway
Variables are labels that we create to make handling objects easier. We have many tricks to help us remember what a variable represents.
