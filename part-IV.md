# Part IV: Using code to accomplish a task
We have a goal in mind before we sit down to write some code, for example:
* compute summary statistics
* make a visualization
* stop climate change

The tricky part is that often it is easy to say what we want in english but hard to write the code to accomplish that task.

**Exercise 1:**
1. Write down a goal you would like to accomplish in your life.
2. Write the code to achieve that goal.
